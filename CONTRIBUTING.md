# CONTRIBUTING

## Ways of CONTRIBUTING
* If you have found an error or would like to suggest a change, report an Issue.
* As soon as the [CLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) is in place, you will be able to provide changes to the respository through the normal [GitHub workflow](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/).
