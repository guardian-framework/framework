## Boyd’s law
>Speed of iteration beats quality of iteration.    
> – Colonel John Boyd

## Defining Right Things Done Right
- Are We Doing the RIGHT THINGS? (To achieve our company’s vision and goals)
- Are We Doing THINGS RIGHT? (To deliver the expected outcomes from our actions)

In practice, the questions become an interdependent loop where the RIGHT THINGS (that should deliver on your company’s business vision) can only be answered by doing THINGS RIGHT (tactical actions that deliver desired outcomes/value) and vice versa. The loop is continuous because what you do, how you do it, and what you learn needs to be constantly evolving and accelerating.

## Justification Of The Choices Made
* Boyd's law help us with the tactical decision of when build from that small working system it's more effective to do many iterations (with potentially less quality) than to over-think the solution to ”get it right the first time”.
