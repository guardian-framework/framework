## Doug McIlroy
> ”This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.”
>
> – Doug McIlroy  

Doug McIlroy's quote is philosophically always good but if you read it more practically from a modern perspective, is it equally valid? Certainly, when it comes to applications housed on "one machine", but what about with distributed systems?

A distributed system has no "programs" and there is also small possibilities to 'stdin / stdout / stderr "... But what if we replace the word "programs" with "components" and looks at "streams" as APIs (ie it should be text (JSON / XML / CSV) and not binary format that is communicated), it becomes equally relevant for distributed systems.


Another very good quote from Doug's

> ”The notion of "intricate and beautiful complexities" is almost an oxymoron. Unix programmers vie with each other for "simple and beautiful" honors — a point that's implicit in these rules, but is well worth making overt.”
> – Doug McIlroy

## Donald Knuth
> ”Premature optimization is the root of all evil”
>
> – Donald Knuth

Donald Knuth's quote is naturally important but incredibly hard to relate to if you work with "organizations" who do not understand and appreciate refactoring of code.

> The Five Stages of Model Development
>
> 1) Decide what you want the model to do
>
> 2) Decide how to build the model
>
> 3) Build the model
>
> 4) Debug the model
>
> 5) Trash stages 1-4 and start again, now that you know what you really wanted.

> – Donald Knuth

A model can, in practice be anything such as a graphical notation, PoC, Lego etc.

## Kent Beck
> “Make It Work, Make It Right, Make It Fast”
>
> – Kent Beck

This is the quote that brilliantly weaves together the ideas of first creating a prototype to show that the initial concept is correct, then refactor the code to "production quality" and then as a last step improve the performance if there is a concrete need for it.


## William of Ockham
> ”It is pointless to do with more what can be done with fewer”
>
> – William of Ockham  

Can even be counter productive.

## Mr. Eugene Lewis Fordsworthe
> ”Assumption is the mother of all screw ups”
>
> – Mr. Eugene Lewis Fordsworthe  

Sounds so simple and still, it's so hard!

## Heraclitus  
> ”The only constant is change”
>
> – Heraclitus  

Exactly, embrace change and make it work for you "resistance is futile".

## Albert Einstein
> ”If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself”
>
> – Albert Einstein

It's always tough to realize that one really didn't understand it as good as one thought.

> ”Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler”
>
> – Albert Einstein

Sir Jonathan Ive is now perhaps the most famous proponent (<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/9283706/Jonathan-Ive-interview-simplicity-isnt-simple.html">TELEGRAPH.CO.UK</a>, <a href="http://youtu.be/1jdPKi5i030">YouTube</a>) for the spirit of this quote.


## Alan Manne
> ”To get a large model to work you must start with a small model  that works, not a large model that doesn't work”
>
> – Alan Manne

Very true and it is equally applicable to code and organizations. An inspiring model for fixing a large model that does not work is Lockheed Martin's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works">Skunk Works</a>... Start over!
