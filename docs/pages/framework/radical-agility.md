## Context
> You may have heard about our cutting-edge approach to the way we work at Zalando Tech – it’s called Radical Agility.

> With Zalando being a platform, we’re growing fast in terms of ambition and scope, so we’re managing our complexity through our people, products, and teams. By utilising Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose, the three pillars of Radical Agility, we want to strengthen our position as the most fashionable tech company in Europe.

> But what exactly is Radical Agility? This methodology sees developers working in autonomous teams, with the company trusting that they'll use the technologies that best fit the job. This all happens amongst team members without the restraints of a traditional, hierarchical management structure. Our management’s role in Radical Agility is instead used to guide the decision-making of teams, while establishing and aligning with employees on the company’s shared purpose and goals.
