## Context

> There are important lessons to be learned from the internet revolution. Firms that have capitalised on its possibilities have rewritten the rules of entire industries such as music and advertising, and internet-enabled business models such as cloud computing have experienced tremendous growth. It is this transformation of business and operating models that is needed to stand the test of time in the digital era. This lesson is starkly illustrated in the high-street by the failure of many bricks and mortar business models to adapt to the threat of Amazon. To be successful now, we believe, requires no less than the creation of enhanced or new business models, new operating models, new ways of interacting with consumers, and new ways of selling.Even the giants of technology are recognising the need to shift and adapt business models. In recent months, Google have launched social networking site Google+ to rival Facebook, and Microsoft have launched the cloud version of Microsoft Office in Office365 to stave off completion from GoogleDocs and similar applications. A commitment to innovation means that even giants need to be agile.Organisations therefore need to develop end-to-end digital engagement strategies and comprehensive digital operating models that address suppliers and employees just as much as customers. They must decide whether they can enhance or transform their existing models, or whether they need to invent a new model.
