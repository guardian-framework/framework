## Motivation behind the choice
* At this moment CaaS hits the sweet spot between infrastructure as a service and PaaS

## Alternatives that could have been chosen, but was not
* CaaS is the logical conclusion after the decision of Containers rather than VMs
* There is a possibility that an "out of the box" PaaS based around containers could merge CaaS & CaaS workflow into a PaaS. and thereby reduce complexity. Today day those options have to many drawbacks to out weight the reduced complexity compared to this solution
