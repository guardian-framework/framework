## Defining Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose
To motivate employees who work beyond basic tasks, give them these three factors to increase performance and satisfaction:
<br><b>Autonomy</b> — Our desire to be self directed. It increases engagement over compliance.
<br><b>Mastery</b> — The urge to get better skills.
<br><b>Purpose</b> — The desire to do something that has meaning and is important. Businesses that only focus on profits without valuing purpose will end up with poor customer service and unhappy employees.
