## Defining Products, not Projects
Efficient processes and practices exist to ensure that projects are completed on time and on budget. Typically, projects are deemed a success within the large firms if they are completed on time and within budget. IT leaders are promoted and fired based on project success or failure, regardless of the impact the software delivers to the bottom line.  

By contrast, upstarts are not worried about projects. They build products that will engage customers and create new ecosystems. They focus on continuously investing in products as assets.

Projects have a definite end, while products do not. The life of a product starts when the technologies deployed are used by the intended users and customers. When a project ends, however, traditional technology units in large enterprises lack the opportunity to assess the true value the technology delivers over its lifespan. This highlights the misalignment between internal technology divisions and the true business goals.

## Justification Of The Choices Made
Customers do not care if your organization is delivering projects on time and on budget. The only thing that matters to them how they engage with your technology products and services.
