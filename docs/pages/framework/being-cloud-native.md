> "Let's face it, all we are doing is writing tomorrow's legacy software today. By making it easy to be strangled in the future, you are enabling the graceful fading away of today's work."

## What Is Cloud Native?
> There is a rough consensus on many Cloud Native traits. Containers as an atomic unit, for example. Micro-services as the means of both construction and communication. Platform independence. Multiple language support. Automation as a feature of everything from build to deployment. High uptime. Ephemeral infrastructure (cattle not pets). And so on.

## Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)
> The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) will harmonize emerging technologies and foster innovation in container packaged, dynamically scheduled, and microservices based application development and operations. The mission of the CNCF is to create and drive the adoption of a new computing paradigm that is optimized for modern distributed systems environments capable of scaling to tens of thousands of self healing multi-tenant nodes.

## Greenfield as Cloud Native, Cloud Native As Greenfield
> In many disciplines a greenfield project is one that lacks constraints imposed by prior work. The analogy is to that of construction on greenfield land where there is no need to work within the constraints of existing buildings or infrastructure.

* When developing/procuring new applications
  * Do it from a clean slate without the restrictions of the current solution
  * Do all new development as Cloud Native
* Handle Legacy according to [Dealing With Legacy](dealing-with-legacy)
