## Defining Created and Proven by Doing
> The traditional foundations businesses relied on in the past to provide a clear enterprise digital strategy, business case, and roadmap forward are non-existent today. Complexity and time to value continue to rapidly expand, while the time horizon of what can be confidently forecast/anticipated has shrunken from years to months.

> The equation of ‘planning to act’ has flipped. Today, digital strategy can only be defined through action.

## Justification Of The Choices Made
People and organizations too often think about all the possible outcomes of different actions instead of just testing and doing something and then seeing what actually comes out. 

Many people talk and brainstorm endlessly without coming to a conclusion, just because they want to cover all the bases and want to get ALL of the opinions before finally taking the first step. Sometimes it’s because people are worried about a possible negative outcome. They don’t want to be seen as a failure. It’s OK to fail.
