## Ship
Ship (Software deployment) is all of the activities that make a software system available for use.

In continuous delivery, we introduce two new architectural attributes: testability and deployability.

In a testable architecture, we design our software such that most defects can (in principle, at least) be discovered by developers by running automated tests on their workstations. We shouldnâ€™t need to depend on complex, integrated environments in order to do the majority of our acceptance and regression testing.

In a deployable architecture, deployments of a particular product or service can be performed independently and in a fully automated fashion, without the need for significant levels of orchestration. Deployable systems can typically be upgraded or reconfigured with zero or minimal downtime.
