summary: The term Microservice Architecture has sprung up over the last few years to describe a particular way of designing software applications as suites of independently deployable services. While there is no precise definition of this architectural style, there are certain common characteristics around organization around business capability, automated deployment, intelligence in the endpoints, and decentralized control of languages and data.

## Defining Microservices
The term **Microservice Architecture** has sprung up over the last few years to describe a particular way of designing software applications as suites of independently deployable services. While there is no precise definition of this architectural style, there are certain common characteristics around organization around business capability, automated deployment, intelligence in the endpoints, and decentralized control of languages and data.

## Justification Of The Choices Made
Microservices provide benefitsâ€¦

**Strong Module Boundaries**: Microservices reinforce modular structure, which is particularly important for larger teams.


**Independent Deployment**: Simple services are easier to deploy, and since they are autonomous, are less likely to cause system failures when they go wrong.


**Technology Diversity**: With microservices you can mix multiple languages, development frameworks and data-storage technologies.
