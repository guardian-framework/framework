## Context
> By 2019, more than 30 percent of the 100 largest vendors' new software investments will have shifted from cloud-first to cloud-only.

> The now well-established stance of cloud-first in software design and planning is gradually being augmented or replaced by cloud-only. This also applies to private and hybrid cloud scenarios.

> "More leading-edge IT capabilities will be available only in the cloud, forcing reluctant organizations closer to cloud adoption. While some applications and data will remain locked in older technologies, more new solutions will be cloud-based, thus further increasing demand for integration infrastructure," said Yefim V. Natis, vice president and Gartner Fellow. "Rigid organizations cannot produce agile IT solutions. As delivery shifts more to the cloud, most IT organizations will have to reorganize to reflect the business realities of cloud computing: continuous innovation and change, pervasive integration, competing with cloud providers for some initiatives, and crucial prevalence of influence over control in IT's relationship with lines of business. While historically the greatest competitor to external service providers has been internal IT, with spend shifts, structural reorganizations and the business realities mentioned above, cloud providers will be in the position to gain the upper hand."

## Motivation behind the choice
* Cloud is the way of the future therefore "On-premise only" is not an option for anybody anymore. The reason to have "Cloud-only" instead of "Cloud-first" is that it does not leave any room to kling to the old way of doing computing. Naturally there will always be situations where on-premise is still the best choice (if you are in the business of running data centers) but for most companies it just prolongs the pain.

## Alternatives that could have been chosen, but was not
* "Cloud-first" strategy
