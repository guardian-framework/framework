summary: In businesses, awareness is the first step to change. An outside-in view helps businesses become aware of customer problems and sets the path towards solutions. A good outside-in perspective involves asking; ‘what are the actors and factors influencing our customers?

## Defining Outside In
Outside-in thinking means that you look at your business from the customer's perspective and subsequently design processes, tools, and products and make decisions based on what's best for the customer and what meets the customer's needs. You make decisions because you know it's what's best for your customers. Why? Because you listen to them, and you understand them and the jobs they are trying to do.

## Justification Of The Choices Made
One of the most common business phenomena is also one of the most perplexing: when successful companies face big changes in their environment, they often fail to respond effectively. Unable to defend themselves against competitors armed with new products, technologies, or strategies, they watch their sales and profits erode, their best people leave, and their stock valuations tumble. Some ultimately manage to recover—usually after painful rounds of downsizing and restructuring—but many don’t.
