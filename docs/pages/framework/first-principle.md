summary: The benefit of "first principles" thinking? It allows you to innovate in clear leaps, rather than building small improvements onto something that already exists.

## Defining First Principle
Rather than taking what already exists as the basis of our thinking, we break the problem down to its most fundamental truths and examine each piece. Even though a problem has already been solved, we start from the problem’s most basic elements to re-examine whether a better solution might be possible.

## Justification Of The Choices Made
Throughout history, thousands of pundits have claimed that a certain industry, design pattern, object or idea had reached its peak. That it could never be improved upon, or produced more cheaply. And most who’ve made these kinds of statements have been proven wrong by the course of innovation. Alternatively, they had predicted only small improvements when drastic improvements were still within reach.

“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”
- *Henry Ford*
