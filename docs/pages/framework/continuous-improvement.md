summary: Continuous improvement is not just a fancy word. It is a natural process which aims to improve our current situation. We don’t want to work harder if we can achieve the same or better result by working smarter. In other words, we want to eliminate all work that isn’t absolutely necessary.

## Boyd’s law
>Speed of iteration beats quality of iteration.    
> – Colonel John Boyd

## Context
> Continuous improvement is a method for identifying opportunities for streamlining work and reducing waste. The practice was formalized by the popularity of Lean / Agile / Kaizen in manufacturing and business, and it is now being used by thousands of companies all over the world to identify savings opportunities. Many of these ideologies can be combined for excellent results. For example, Kaizen and Kanban can go hand-in-hand to facilitate continuous improvement.

> While many companies practice a formal version of a Lean / Agile method, other companies enjoy the flexibility of continuous improvement as a practice while reserving the right to deviate from the practice whenever a less formal approach is needed.
