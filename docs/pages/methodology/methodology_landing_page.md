## Introduction
In an digital transformation there are two transformations that need to take place; team and organizational structure and technical architecture.

The 'Inverse Conway Maneuver' (based on Conways Law) recommends evolving your team and organizational structure first to promote your desired architecture.

### Conway’s Law
> Any organization that designs a system (defined more broadly here than just information systems) will inevitably produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.  
> <br>– Melvin Conway

## Eliminating the Need for a "Big Bang"
When doing all sorts of transformation risk and speed are key areas for success. One pattern that reduce risk and increase speed is the "Strangler Pattern" that enable both the old and the new to co-exist.
